		<h3> SCENE 1</h3>
		<p><strong>Summary</strong>  A thunderstorm approaches and three witches convene. 
They agree to confront the great Scot general Macbeth upon his victorious
return from a war between Scotland and Norway. Soon, heroic Macbeth will
receive the title of Thane of Cawdor from King Duncan. However, Macbeth
learns from the witches that he is fated for greater things and he will be led 
down the path of destruction by his unquenchable ambition.</p>
<p><i>A desert place.<i></p>
<p><i>Thunder and lightning. Enter three Witches.<i></p>
<p>
First Witch
When shall we three meet again
 In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

Second Witch
When the hurlyburly's done,
 When the battle's lost and won.

Third Witch 
That will be ere the set of sun.

First Witch 
Where the place?

Second Witch 
Upon the heath.

Third Witch 
There to meet with Macbeth.

First Witch 
I come, Graymalkin!

Second Witch 
Paddock calls.

Third Witch 
Anon.

ALL 
Fair is foul, and foul is fair:
Hover through the fog and filthy air.
